#! The mapping done by this script is the opposite from that done by the
#! `@read_lab` procedure and the `Read HTK label file...` script in this plugin.
#! Multiple TextGrid objects will be mapped to different alternatives within
#! a single label file, and multiple interval tiers will be mapped to as many
#! levels for the corresponding alternative.
#!
#! Since only interval tiers are supported at the moment, all lines in the
#! generated label files will have start and end times.
